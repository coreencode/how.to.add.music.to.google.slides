Adding audio to your presentation, whether it’s gentle background music for a wedding slideshow or a voice recording for a remote learning session, can keep your audience interested, engaged, and entertained. Here’s how to do it with Google Slides.


## Uploading Audio to Google Drive
* If you don’t already have your audio file uploaded to Google Drive, head over to your Google Drive account and click the “New” button in the top-left corner of the window.
* Next, click “File Upload” in the menu that appears.
* File Explorer (or Finder on Mac) will open. Locate and select the file you want to upload and then click “Open.”

## How to Import Audio to Google Slides
* Once the audio file is uploaded, open your Google Slides presentation that you’d like to add the audio to, click “Insert” in the menu bar, and then click “Audio.”
* The “Insert Audio” window will appear. In the “My Drive” tab, select the file you’d like to upload by clicking it.
* Next, click the blue “Select” button in the bottom-left corner of the window.
